ORR includes a mapping builder to create and edit mappings between concepts and terms in multiple ontologies 
or controlled vocabularies. Mapping between controlled vocabularies in a given domain is essential to
interoperability between different data systems in the domain. In other words, it is important to have 
a machine-readable way for a search computer to understand how terms are related (for example, 
if one term is equivalent to, more general than, or narrower than another term).

Doing accurate mapping requires an in-depth knowledge of the meaning of the terms in each vocabulary. 
It is usually most efficient to gather a small group of domain experts, who are familiar with the 
controlled vocabularies, together for an in-person mapping session. In addition to the domain experts, 
the mapping team may also include a facilitator, recorder, tools specialist, ontology specialist, 
domain lead, and communication liaison. (See the [http://marinemetadata.org/workshoptemp)).
